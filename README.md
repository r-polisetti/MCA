## 📅 How to Add or Update Events
Open events.json

Add events in this format:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Project Launch",
    "description": "Final release of the platform",
    "date": "2025-06-20T00:00:00",
    "startDate": "2025-06-01T00:00:00"
  }
]
```
Date must be in full ISO format (e.g. YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss)
startDate is optional — if not given, current time is used.
